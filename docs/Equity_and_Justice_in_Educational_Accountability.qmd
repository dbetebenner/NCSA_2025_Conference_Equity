## I was clueless!

:::{.incremental}

- Going back several years, I'd hear colleagues frequently using the term "equity" to characterize the work they were doing.
- It seemed like a good thing. It's not like I support inequity.
- But in the end, I really didn't know what it meant.
- I'd heard about DEI programs and interventions that characterize themselves as equity-focused.
- But those are **inputs** and I'm an **outputs** guy.
- I was curious: _How would one characterize/recognize and ultimately quantify equity in terms of the outputs we all know and love - state summative assessment results?_
- So what did I do? This was pre-ChatGPT so I started Googling.

## The Famous Infographic

## This Gave Me Some Ideas -- Here's What I Saw

:::::{.columns}

::::{.column width="50%"}

:::{.incremental}

- I saw the fence as a metaphor for the "proficiency" requirements and the individuals seeing over the fence as demonstrating proficiency.
- I saw disparate proficiency outcomes represented by some individuals seeing over the fence and others not.
- I saw **Equality**, where "input" boxes are of equal height, not eliminating proficiency disparities.
- I saw **Equity**, where "input" boxes adjust in height to the need of the individual, leading to the elimination of proficiency disparities.
- I felt like I was starting to get it.

## Sippin the EquiTEA made some good points!

:::::{.columns}

::::{.column width="50%"}

:::{.incremental}

- Making the children different heights implicitly blames the student for not being able to see over the fence.
- The graphic doesn't address the uneven playing field associated with the systemic inequities that exist in our society.
- So I wanted to see if I could come up with a graphic that merges these ideas together.

## I'm Not Saying

:::{.incremental}

- This is perfect or better than other illustrations.
- This is original or the best way to think about these ideas. 
- It did, however, help me get some traction on how ideas like equity and justice could be quantified in terms of the outputs we all know and love - state summative assessment results.
- That's what I'm going to run with for the rest of this presentation.

## Making Sense of Equity

:::::{.columns}

::::{.column width="60%"}

:::{.incremental}

- The boxes represent the equity "contribution".
- The contribution includes, for example, supplemental learning interventions and supports to help students who are behind "catch up".
- The height of the boxes represents the magnitude of the contribution or, conversely, the magnitude of the inequity (academic headwinds) to overcome.
- These contributions would manifest themselves as higher rates of growth (academic tailwinds) for those students. 
- The critical insight here is that student growth is the basis for investigating equity.

## Student Growth as an Equity Indicator

:::{.incremental}

- To investigate equity vis-Ã -vis student growth, we need a measure of student growth that allows different groups to demonstrate different rates of growth.
- If one only wants to make between group equity comparisons within a given year, then norm-referenced SGPs are sufficient. 
- If one want to investigate equity over time, for example, at the state level, then baseline referenced SGPs are required.

## Visualization - Growth as an Equity Indicator

:::{.incremental}

- The mosaic plot depicts percentages of students demonstrating different levels of growth based upon the growth needed by the student.
- The widths of the columns represent the current percentage of students in each category (in this instance one third in each category)
- The heights of the rectangles represent the percentage of students in each category demonstrating that amount of growth.
- With cohort-referenced SGPs or baseline-referenced SGPs in the baseline year, SGPs will be uniformly distributed.
  - For cohort-referenced SGPs, SGPs for subgroups (e.g., a district) needn't be uniformly distributed within year. 
  - For baseline-referenced SGPs, SGPs for the entire state or for subgroups needn't be uniformly distributed following the baseline year.

## Making Sense of Justice

:::::{.columns}

::::{.column width="60%"}

:::{.incremental}

- The downward slope of the ground represents the myriad of systemic factors (many outside of the control of the education system) that impact student outcomes.
- Equity, the boxes, represents what needs to be done to overcome these systemic disparities.
- Justice entails the amelioration of the systemic factors that impact student outcomes.

## Systemic Factors 

:::{.incremental}

- There's a corollary to the way justice is characterized to some different assumptions that current growth models make.
- Often, we use demographic variables as proxies to account for systemic factors that impact student outcomes.
- Many value-added models incorporate individual and group level demographic characteristics to account for the impact of systemic factors on student outcomes.
- I would argue, in line with Peter Drucker, that if our interest is in ameliorating systemic factors that impact student outcomes, then we need to measure them directly.
- Bill Sanders, when discussing the use of demographics in value-added modeling, feared that their incorporation was sweeping the problem under the rug.

## The Future of Equity and Justice in Educational Accountability

:::{.incremental}

- Begin running growth based equity analyses and visualizations for interested state clients.
- Move beyond demographic proxy variables and incorporate more direct measures of systemic factors that impact student outcomes.
- Consider how such indicators can be used to inform policy and practice and potentially as part of accountability systems.
